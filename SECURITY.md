# Security policy

## Promise

At Kernel, we aim to provide our users with a safe and secure environment. We welcome any contribution from external security researchers.

## Scope

If you believe you have found a security issue in any software, service, or website governed by Kernel, we encourage you to notify us.

Our intention is to help improve the Web by applying best practices learned over the past two decades and combine them with new emerging technology in cryptography and blockchain.

It may not always be obvious whether an issue should be reported as a bug or a security issue. When in doubt, please report it as a security issue first.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have identified a security issue with any of the code or its dependencies, you can report it by sending an email to security@kernel.community.

Please include a proof-of-concept of the exploit, or any other pointers that can help us assess the risk level.

Thank you for helping to keep the Kernel secure.
